            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doctoral Thesis Student</strong>, KAIST, South Korea (2020 – Present)<br>
                    Conducted a systematic review to identify key obstacles in existing modeling methods for exoskeletons.<br>
                    Developed a novel kinematic model for simulating shoulder range of motion (ROM), demonstrating high accuracy (0.3%-14.3% discrepancy) between simulated and measured data.<br>
                    Built a simplified kinetic model for predicting static balance in exoskeleton users, achieving strong correlations with subjective instability ratings (r=0.79) and small differences from existing models.<br>
                    Developing an experiment-free musculoskeletal modelling solution for shoulder exoskeletons.<br>
                    Constructing a general modelling framework for the ergonomic evaluation of industrial exoskeletons, designed to streamline model development for researchers, saving time and effort in design and evaluation processes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Master Thesis Student</strong>, Jilin University, China (2017 – 2020)<br>
                    Examined the relationship between human body dimension, seat setting, seat pressure distribution, and user comfort.<br>
                    Developed a pressure distribution-based comfort evaluation method, showing a strong correlation between movement frequency and comfort level.<br>
                    Created a data-driven comfort seat position distribution model considering user anthropometry and seat angles.
